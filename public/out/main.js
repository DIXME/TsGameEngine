 * - make a function that handles drawing shapes with roation
 * and merge the two methods (the way it knows what to do is a paramater)
 * the parameter is opitinal and the defualt value is false (outline: defualt)
 *
 * - draw 3d shapes (3d projection)
 *
 * - create real gameObjects that update after we
 * create rendering functions
 *
 * - figure out how to rotate a circle
 *
 * - make images
 *
 * - make image game Obejcts

/** ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep In Mind ‚ö†Ô∏è
 * when we get to 2d & 3d roation we have to keep in mind that what where doing is
 * getting the martix
 * applying the martix to all points of the polygon
 * this means that we need to make our own function to create rects and other shapes that draw them
 * based on there points and not ctx.fillRect
